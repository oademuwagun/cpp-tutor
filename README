CPP Tutor
====================

This is a tool that enables C++ beginners to visualize the step-by-step execution of their code.
It helps them to see the creation of the data, the various forms of the data, the manipulation and destruction of data during run-time.

The goal is for this tool to be the quivalent of the Online Python Tutor (www.pythontutor.com).

Currently, the tool supports the following features:

- Visualization of primitive types, strings, and arrays
- Visualization of the call stack

This is a new project so it is lacking a lot of key features. However, I am currently working on adding several new features such as:

- User interface enhancements such as the current line indicator
- Visualization of structs, enums, and unions



Pre-requisites
----------------

- Python (just to be safe, use 2.7).

- gdb with support for Python scripting. 

- Django 1.5 and higher


Set Up
---------

- Change the first of the analyze.py ("#!/usr/bin/gdb -x") to "[GDB INSTALL DIR] -x"

- Go to the project directory, run "python manage.py runserver [PORT_NUMBER]." If a PORT_NUMBER is not specified, it defaults to 8000.


How It Works
--------------

- The user enters and submits C++ code as input.

- Once the code is submitted, it is handled by the Django app at the backend. 

- The code is then compiled. If there are errors, the errors are then displayed to the user.

- If there are no errors, the code is then executed. The results are compiled.
