CPP Tutor
====================

This is a tool that enables C++ beginners to visualize the step-by-step execution of their code.
It helps them to see the creation of the data, the various forms of the data, the manipulation and destruction of data during run-time.

The goal is for this tool to be the quivalent of the Online Python Tutor (www.pythontutor.com).

Currently, the tool supports the following features:

- Visualization of primitive types, strings, and arrays
- Visualization of the call stack

I am currently working on adding several new features:



Set Up
------------

- Ensure you have Python installed (just to be safe, use 2.7).

- Ensure you have gdb installed and that the gdb version installed supports Python scripting.
